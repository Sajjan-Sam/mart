I want to build a web application using React for a hostel marketplace where students can buy and sell items. The app should have a modern, responsive design. Key features: 1) A home page that lists all products for sale in a card/grid layout, showing each product’s image, name, price, and a Buy/Contact button. 2) When the Buy/Contact button is clicked, it should open a WhatsApp chat with the seller of that product (use the seller’s phone number and include a pre-filled message like ‘Hello, I’m interested in your [item name]’). 3) A form page for adding a new product listing, with fields for product name, description, price, category (optional), seller name, and seller’s WhatsApp number, plus an image upload. Upon submission, the new product should appear in the listings. 4) Use React Router for navigation (e.g., routes for the home/listings page, and for the add-listing form; optionally a route for product details). 5) Use a UI framework (like Bootstrap or Material-UI) or styled-components to make the design look clean and attractive (for example, nice buttons, card layout, navbar). 6) No backend is required – you can store data in React state (and use localStorage for persistence of listings). 7) Please provide the React code (components, routes, and any CSS) needed to implement this, and ensure the WhatsApp integration link is correctly formatted. Include comments or explanations in the code where useful.”** It should also a admin login just enter a password"iiserhostel2025" and handle like delete of products , allow to shows items requested and to see suggestions and details, there should also a option so that seller can click sold it shows option to enter mobile number so that only seller can done it sold and there should another options to flag it unappropriate if user sells some unappropriate product.
